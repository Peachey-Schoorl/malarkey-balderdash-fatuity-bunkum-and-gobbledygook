# Its dull stone eyes staring out at nothing.

> A town square. A small girl. A statue of a bull's head.
> Inner turmoil. Uncertainty. A choice

The statue had been there as long as the town had. As neither the statue, nor the town, had any markings stating the year of their creation, no one knew how old either really were. Or which came first.

Protruding from a building in the town square, it portrayed the head of a bull.
It was mostly true to life except for the horn which were bigger than any bull's.

The girl in front of the bull's visage had been standing there decidedly shorter. However, measured on the scale of her young age, it was beginning to verge on a very long time indeed.

Staring into the bull's dull stone eyes, she saw nothing of the wisdom or benevolence the townsfolk spoke of. All she could see was sadness and, maybe, boredom.

She could still vividly remember the first time her parents had taken her along to see the bull.

Her older brothers had told her about it, but at the time it all seemed silly to her. If it had been a _real_ bull, she might have cared, but a stone one did nothing to excite her imagination.

That day, somehow, had been different. When she went outside to see what the noise was that had woken her up, there was a tense mood in the house. A sort of excitement she had not encountered before in her young live.

The source of the noise was her father, outside at the anvil, pounding a coin   with hammer and metal punch, to make hole in it.

A real coin!

This did not make sense to her at all, compared to the reverence coins usually received.

So when her father explained to her he was doing this so they could ask the bull to grant them a good year, she decided she had to come along and see for herself.

## The statue

In the old town square, sticking out of the side of a building was the statue of the bull's head.

Worn slick over the centuries by sun, rain, and the hands of the villagers, the stone head looked more like a veneration of a bull than the real thing. An idol to some unknowable god.

From it's horns hung coins on strings, placed there by the villagers to advance their dreams and desires. Their wishes and needs. Plying for any advantage to bring them even an inch closer to their goals.

Although no one in the village could tell you _how_ they knew, everyone knew to only hang real coins on the bulls left horn. And only hang stone, glass, or wooden wishing coins on the right. No one would be as crass as to call them "fake" but that was what they were. With the exception of some foreign coins their owners were not sure of where to place.

As real coins were noticeably more valuable than their stand-ins, the left side of the horn was much less adorned  than its counterpart. So much so that one would not be amiss to wonder if the statue would not grow lopsided by the difference, were it not for the fact that the fake coins were considerably less in weight as well as value.

Not that there was a difference to the villagers, or the bull, for that matter.

A coin was a coin, whether one offered a hefty golden piece or a humble wooden button, as long as it had a hole in it and was hung on the appropriate horn. It didn't even matter if it was hung from a dainty ribbon, a single twine, or corded grass.

No one was denied their petition to grab the bull by the horns.

Just like the house itself, the stone bull protruding from its side had always just been there. Built at the very starts of the village's long life.

So had the ribbons and strings hanging form its horns. Some were shiny and new. Others old and weathered. But all had a coin dangling from their end.

And no-one ever removed a coin, once it hung there. Never. Not even that one time, long ago, when raiders had come to town, taking everything they could carry. Including the village pump. Some said the raiders even added a few coins of their own. that was why they were never caught. And as long as their coins remained hanging there, they wouldn't be...

## The girl

As creased as her forehead was, so smooth was the statue's skin.

They made a pair of opposites. She, small, young and colorful. He, large, ancient and dull.

ðŸ™§âœ§ðŸ™¥

She had always known it was just a fancy. No amount of whishes or prayers ever changed anything. Yet here she was, with a coin on a ribbon, to hang on the horn of this statue of a bull.

All of her needs and fears and desires represented by this one token. This simple gesture. This futile, useless, stupid...

Taking a deep breath, she stopped her anger from welling up further.

She hung the ribbon with the coin on the bull's horn and headed back home.

## The coin

The coin hung from a ribbon. The ribbon hung from a horn. The horn was attached to the stone head of a bull, who was attached to a house. The house stood in the square of a village in the middle of nowhere.
